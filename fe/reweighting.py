        """Assumes samples x_k[k] are drawn from e^{-u_fxn(x, lambdas[k], ref_params)}.

        The constructor will
        * aggregate all the samples into a flat structure xs (dropping information about which lambda window each sample
            came from),
        * precompute a matrix "u_kn" containing u_fxn(x, lam, ref_params) for x in xs, lam in lambdas, and
        * pass this matrix to pymbar.MBAR to form self-consistent estimates for the free energies of all lambda windows.

        These free energy estimates in turn imply statistical weights of each sample x in a weighted mixture of the
        sampled lambda windows. These "importance weights" allow us to re-use the samples xs to compute arbitrary
        expectations in thermodynamic states that have sufficient "overlap" with this weighted mixture.

        Crucially, if we know how to differentiate U_fxn w.r.t. params, then
        we also know how to differentiate the importance weights w.r.t. params.

        In particular, to compute a differentiable estimate for the free energy difference between lam=1.0 and lam=0.0,
        using the same potential energy function u_fxn but a possibly new parameter set params, we need to be able to
        compute u_fxn(x, lam=0, params), u_fxn(x, lam=1, params) and their gradients w.r.t. params on all cached xs.
